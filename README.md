Sketch using a modified Mozzi SampleHuffman class to play an audio sample at the press of the button (when pin D4 is held low.) Audio output as per standard Mozzi conventions, pin D9 on an Arduino.

Audio is the classic stock sound effect known as the [Wilhelm scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream)
downloaded from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/WilhelmScreamSample) and downsampled using
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to fit within flash memory of an Arduino
